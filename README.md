# OpenLitterMap-language-files
# The beginning of open source

Hello to the open pollution revolution! The sooner people stop wasting their time creating redundant data the better.

Attached are some language files for OpenLitterMap.

Feel welcome to clone and add in your language in its respective subdirectory so we can translate OpenLitterMap into many languages and enable a global community of open pollution revolutionaries. Yay science!

Soon we will go completely open source, I just need to get a handle on a few things first.

As you can see from OpenLitterMap.com, language files are already done in English, French, Spanish, Turkish & Malay. These do not need to be duplicated.

If you like my work, or maybe you think what I'm doing is important, please support so we can do this sooner rather than later?
